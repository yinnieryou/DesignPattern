I HOPE this repo written in Swift can help someone who is learning design pattern. 

But actually, I didn't finish this project now.I mean a lot of design patterns not include in my project.

Here is a list what i had wrriten in my project.
1.AbstractFactory
2.Builder
3.ChainOfResponsibility
4.Command
5.FactoryMethod
6.Interator
7.Interpreter
8.Mediator
9.Memento
10.Observer
11.Prototype
12.Singleton
13.Strategy
14.TemplateMethods
15.Visitor

And in the Principle directory ,there are some file about the principle of design pattern.

Hope you love it.
